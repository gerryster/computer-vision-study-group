# Computer Vision Study Group

This repo contains code and used as part of my computer vision study group. More information about this group [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11lrBxT2PjmspmWQ14Av2Sh1bYO1e5vTNo3ZEdfEjjyk/edit?usp=sharing).

## Installation

Install the Python version specified in the .tool-versions file and then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing

From the root directory of this project, run:

```bash
pytest
```

## Attribution

The study group and this repository are based on "[Programming Computer Vision with Python](http://programmingcomputervision.com/)" by Jan Erik Solem (O'Reilly Media, 2012). The example-images directory is from that book and is included in this project for ease of reference and so that Git can notify me if I accidentally change any of the original images.
